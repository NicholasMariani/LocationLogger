# LocationLogger
A basic android application to keep track of a specific location on a map view.

# How to Use
When you reach a location you want to keep track of, click the '+' button on the bottom left of the screen. This will be stored in a local database for future use.
When you want to return to this location, click on the 'Begin Search' button on the bottom right of the screen. A text view will appear detailing how far your current location is to your destination in meters. 
When you have arrived at your destination, a dialog will present asking if you have found you location or if you need to keep searching.
When completing the search, the map marker will be converted to a traditional marker for later use. This marker can be reused as the destination if you long press on the marker.
